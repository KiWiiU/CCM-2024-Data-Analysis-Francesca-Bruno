This was a data science project for the County College of Morris to analyze data from surveys they sent to their computer science students to increase enrollment in computing classes.
I was assigned the Non-Majors dataset, which is the survey results from students who take computing classes at CCM even though it is outside of their major.
The files in this folder are:
  CLEANED_Majors2024.csv (The results from students in computer science majors after cleaning the data according to this analysis' needs)
  CLEANED_NonMajors2024.csv (The results from students not in computer science majors after cleaning the data according to this analysis' needs)
  MajorsSurveyResults2024.csv (The results from students in computer science majors before cleaning)
  Non-Majors Survey Results - Fall 2024.csv (The results from students not in computer science majors before data cleaning)
  Project1Part2Cleaning.ipynb (The Jupyter Notebook that has the code that cleans the data)
  Project1Part3Analysis.ipynb (The Jupyter Notebook that has the code that analyzes the data)
